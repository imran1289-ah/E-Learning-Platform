# SOEN342_E-Learning-Platform

## Project Description
This project is a E-Academy platform which allows university students to get help with the courses that they are taking. These students can enroll for many lessons which are taught by PhD and master's graduate. The tutors can meet with with the students in person or could give remote lessons. The courses offered in the application covers many lessons/courses from majors Engineering, Computer Sciences etc. 

## Objective
The objectives of this project is to simulate the requirement engineering process in order to build a E-academy platform allowing students and tutors to connect with each other. The system should have features that will be different and or better than its competitors. In the first sprint, a proposal of the applicaiton was made were requirement elicitation techniques such as comparative study and questionaire were conducted to get the requirements. In the second sprint, a vision document was made discussing about the application in more depth ranging from the objective, stakeholders, features, use cases etc. In the third sprint, a mockup of the interface was made using Figma and a change management and testing section were added to the vision document.

## Features of the proposed system
- Login/Register for an account (student,tutor,guest or admin)
- Cart to allow users to pay for their course(s)/lesson(s) enrolled.
- Schedule Meetings with tutors
- Class Forum for students and tutors to connect
- Search/Filter for courses/lessons 
- Calender system for tutor/students
- Request Mangement System

## Tools and Techniques
- Comparative Study
- Survey/Questionnaire
- Vision Document
- Figma
